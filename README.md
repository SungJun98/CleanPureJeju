21 Big-Contest

My team (Chung-Jeong Clean Pure Jeju) participated in 21 Big-Contest.
You can check my teammates @hwihwi @sjk.

The task was predicting food wastes of administrative division of Jeju-Island.

We did from preprocessing data to fitting models and getting predictions.

If you want to check about what we did, you can watch this repository freely.
